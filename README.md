# HACKUTD
UTD Hackathon Nov. 9-10 2019

My team (Sasha, Kyu) and I competed in the Fannie Mae Datascience challenge. The given dataset was mortgage loan data ranging from 2000 to 2019. The goal was to predict whether a borrower would pre-pay, stay up-to-date, or default on a loan based on statistics. 

"Work.R" contains the final code we presented to the judges after 24 hours of competing. Concisely summarized: it re-organizes the dataset and fills in some NA values. Then, it performs the analysis - consisting of a several Random Forests, each with different parameters, and then the AdaBoost method, which performed better.

The files starting with "Loss" have some template code related to the datasets.
